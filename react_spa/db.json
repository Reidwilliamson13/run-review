      "description": "This park has been an all time favorite. I don't know if it's all the nature, the closeness to the lake, or the fact that there's a train that runs throughout the middle of the trail and park, this is one of the nicest places to get a good run in and enjoy the scenary at the same time.",

      "description": "This park is nearest to my place so I go running quite often here. Although it lacks a lot of the beautiful scenary the others have, it does have plenty of hills and steep inclines if you are like me these help to provide good resistance which makes for a better workout.",

If there is anything that stands out for this park it is the newly paved walk way. The Cherrydale apartments in the area make for a great city run with nice mom and pop shops along the way.",

      "description": "The old W&OD trail is an all time favorite of many locals because of the sheer history and backlog that this historic trail covers. It used to be an old commercial rail road track that ran all the way from more western parts of Virginia. The trail is a great place for an open country run, trees in abundance, breweries along the way. What more could you ask for? This trail has it all!",
