          This app is for running enthusiasts like myself who are interested in
          discovering all of Northern Virginia's beautiful parks and running
          trails. I will be posting a new park or trail every week with a
          description and pictures. The idea is to provide information on new
          trails, what to expect, level of difficulty, and safety information.
