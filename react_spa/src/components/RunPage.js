        <h2>Burke Lake Park</h2>
        <p>
          This has been an all time favorite. I don't know if it's all the
          nature, the closeness to the lake, or the fact that there's a train
          that runs throughout the middle of the trail and park, this is one of
          the nicest places to get a good run in and enjoy the scenary at the
          same time.
