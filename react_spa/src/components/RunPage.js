        <h2>Week of 2/7 - 2/13</h2>
        <p>
          The weather has held up this week in terms of no rain or snow, here's
          this week's list:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Burke Lake Park, Burke</li>
          <li>Lake Accotink, Manassas</li>
          <li>Armistead Park, Fairfax</li>
          <li>Cherrydale Park, Arlington</li>
          <li>W & OD Trail, Reston</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Burke Lake Park</h2>
        <p>
          This has been an all time favorite. I don't know if it's all the
          nature, the closeness to the lake, or the fact that there's a train
          that runs throughout the middle of the trail and park, this is one of
          the nicest places to get a good run in and enjoy the scenary at the
          same time.

        <h2>Lake Accotink Park</h2>
        <p>
          Lake Accotink continues to be one of the areas most popular tourist locations for families as the park ahas recently updated ammenities making it a great place for young families. Also the running trail has since been renovated and has wonderful views of the lake and man made waterfalls.

      <div>
        <h2>Armistead Park</h2>
        <p>
          This park is nearest to me and so I go running here quite often. Though it lacks a lot of beautiful sights the others on the list have, it does have plenty of hills and steep inclines if you are like me these help to provide good resistance which makes for a better workout.

      <div>
        <h2>Cherrydale Park</h2>
        <p>
          This park is located right in the center of bustling Cherrydale, VA. If you like a good city run, this is the trail for you. It may not actually be a trail. This is closer to a concrete jungle. Plenty of cool shops though if you want to get a quick refreshment at the end of your workout!

        <h2>W & OD Trail</h2>
        <p>
          The W & OD trail is a great trail. This trail spans across several county lines as it used to be a rail road line that went all the way from western VA into the heart of the nation's capital. This is more than just a good running trail, there are several historial markers and information booths that mark along the trail making this one of the most interesting trails in all of Northern Virginia.
